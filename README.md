This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### About

The slider is build using create-react-app. It was tested only on Chrome on Windows 10. Recommended viewing is on desktop with a larger screen then 1024x768(no time for responsive fixes). I chose a bit more unconventional design then say, a landing page, with more focus on the contrast between current photo and next/previous. I added a bit more playfulness to the animations. I added some sample texts about each photo to fill out the empty space. I did this design to try and make it as clean as possible for an exclusive feel. Perhaps it would be suitable not for a landing page but rather an art-portfolio or a premium broker website, for exampel when viewing photos from an object this design could be on an overlay.

### Features that would be good
left and right tabs are disabled when viewing last or first slide.

Navigation 'dots' that highlight the current photo in the order, these dots would be an option for navigation also.

light and dark viewing mode.

timed animation on each different text section that flows beautifully.

more experimentation with animations.
